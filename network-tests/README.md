# Network Tests

This directory presents the results of Network and Performance tests.

The Test Results titled V3 were used as the final version to produce our [initial Test Report](./../docs/test-report.md).

The Test Results titled V4 and V5 were used to produce our [Test Report - Istio Ambient vs Istio Sidecar](./../docs/test-report-istio.md).

## Structure

Each folder presents a test iteration. There were 3 iterations of tests which were used to improve the accuracy and reliability of our results.

Each folder contains the below subfolders, but their content may vary.

### Diagrams

Below you can see the structure of `Diagrams` folder:

```txt
